#Codetrotters Fellowship Coding Challenge 2015


##About

**[CodeTrotters Fellowship](http://www.codetrotters.com/fellowship)** 
links promising developers with global startups so they
can get invaluable real life experience.

As part of the application process we post a coding challenge every year. 

You can read more about the CodeTrotters Fellowship at [http://www.codetrotters.com/fellowship](http://www.codetrotters.com/fellowship)


##Participating in the Challenge

To participate in this challenge, you need a github account.
Fork this repository, once you finish with your solution
sends us a Pull Request.

We are looking forward to read all your solutions!

##Challenge

Write a function called **int_to_word** that takes as an input an integer parameter and returns the associated English word. You can assume the function will never receive a number greater than 999,999,999.

You can code this on the programming language of your choice.

##Examples

```
int_to_word(4527)     == "four thousand five hundred twenty seven"
int_to_word(200017)   == "two hundred thousand seventeen"
int_to_word(784)      == "seven hundred eighty four"
int_to_word(1000215)  == "one million two hundred fifteen"
```

## Very small change: 
    - added 'and' in the phrase where appropiate. seemed more natural
